# K&R C Programming Solutions

This repository contains my solutions and observations for exercises from  
**“The C Programming Language” by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie (K&R)**.

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Practice C programming fundamentals
- Understand compiler errors and warnings
- Maintain clean, structured solutions for revision
